# handlebars-helper-include [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/handlebars-helper-include.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/handlebars-helper-include)

> Handlebars helper for using includes.

## Install
Use [npm](npmjs.org) to install the package: `npm i handlebars-helper-include`.

## Register the helper

Register the helper in the `assemble` task in your project's Gruntfile to begin using it in templates:

```javascript
grunt.initConfig({
  assemble: {
    options: {
      // the 'handlebars-helper-include' npm module must also be listed in
      // devDependencies for assemble to automatically resolve the helper
      helpers: ['handlebars-helper-include', 'foo/*.js']
    },
    files: {
      '_gh_pages/': ['templates/*.hbs']
    }
  }
});
```

## Usage

### Register includes

Tell assemble where to find the includes by adding an `includes` property to the task options:

```javascript
assemble: {
  options: {
    includes: ['abc.hbs', 'xyz.hbs', 'foo/*.hbs']
  },
  files: {
    '_gh_pages/': ['templates/*.hbs']
  }
}
```

### Use in templates

Define the name of the helper to include, without file extension:

```html
{{include 'abc'}}
```

Optionally pass a context as the second parameter:

```html
{{include 'xyz' this}}
```

### Wildcard patterns

Globbing patterns may also be used:

```html
{{include 'chapter-*'}}
```
